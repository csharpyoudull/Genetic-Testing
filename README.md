Genetic-Testing
===============

Second attempt at a genetic algorithm.

**How it works**<br>
Binary strings are created from a random population of chromosomes, once created mutation and crossover are applied in an attempt to increase the overall effectiveness of the population.

**Interesting points**<br>
Trying playing around with the crossover rate, mutation rate, population size and max generations to see how they impact the system.
